This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Set up

Download or clone this repo then run:
`npm install` to install all dependencies.

Once dependencies are install run: `npm start` - the app should then be available on localhost:3000

## Notes

You will need to hold the ALT key to highlight text. I added this in order to allow users to still select portions of text for other purposes (e.g copy) without having the text highlighted automatically.
